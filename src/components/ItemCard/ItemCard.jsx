//clothing item cards, filtered based on current weather
// wrap ItemCard componenet into unordered list and use filter() and map() methods

//ItemCard is a component that renders the image and title for an item of clothing.
//Moreover, the image is an interactive element, meaning that if the user clicks on it, the item modal will open.
//Note that the item card itself doesnâ€™t know about the modal state. Therefore, you need to pass it down from App to Main.
//In other words, when the user clicks on the image, you need to call the state change function handleCardClick() that ItemCard receives as a prop

      <img className="card__image" src={item.link} alt={item.name} />
